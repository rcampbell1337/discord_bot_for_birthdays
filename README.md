# BirthdayBot

Started out as a very low effort piece of work i was going to complete in an hour or two, but kept on growing.

Stores peoples birthdays to mongodb and once a day checks if any birthdays are coming up! That simple, full CRUD software with some nice datetime logic to boot.

Utilises Hikari to create a really nice lightweight Discord bot.

# Proud of this one :shipit:
